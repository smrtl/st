st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.
The ligatures patch requires the harfbuzz header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.


Applied patches
---------------
This customised st contains the following patches:

- scrollback with mouse wheel (incl. altscreen) support
- font ligatures support
- alpha + focus: different background colors and opacity values depending on
  whether the termimal is focused or not
- better support for image in terminal (w3m images hack)
